# TO DO
* instead of using the full base url, use the part following `http{s}://`


## FUTURE
* when adding possibility to create a page: canvas uses the page title in lower case with dashes for spaces as url for the page:
*
`title_for_page = 'Testing Canvas API'``
`page_name = 'testing-canvas-api' # title_for_page.lower().replace(' ','-')``
