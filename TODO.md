# TO DO
* how to deal with sending a file to the root folder:
    - https://uio.instructure.com/courses/4258/files/folder/
* instead of using the full base url, use the part following `http{s}://`
* implement creating a new folder in a new folder in one operation
* when creating a new page, optionally leave unpublished
* when creating a new page, check whether page already exists
* capture urls with double forward slashes `//`
* enable adding any item using add_to_module (add_to_module can figure out file versus folder and adjust accordingly)
