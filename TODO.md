# TO DO
* how to deal with sending a file to the root folder:
    - https://uio.instructure.com/courses/4258/files/folder/
* instead of using the full base url, use the part following `http{s}://`
* implement creating a new folder in a new folder in one operation
* remove `files+folders.ipynb`

## FUTURE
* when adding possibility to create a page: canvas uses the page title in lower case with dashes for spaces as url for the page:
*
`title_for_page = 'Testing Canvas API'``
`page_name = 'testing-canvas-api' # title_for_page.lower().replace(' ','-')``
