# Contributing

I welcome contributions! In order for you to help develop this software:

* you will need to install [canvasAPI](https://canvasapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pathlib](https://pypi.org/project/pathlib/)
* ideally, have a Canvas account available to try out the commands
    - for example, a dummy or sandbox course or a course where you can add some pages, files and modules
* get the [Canvas API key](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-14409-4214861717) of your try-out course. and set up the config file as described in the README
* Download this repo and make sure `cvpython.py -h` runs successfully
* there are some tests that can be run using, for example, `pytest` (I welcome more tests!)
*  have a look at the [TODO.md](TODO.md) file
